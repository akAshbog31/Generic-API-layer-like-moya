Introduction

The "Async-Await-API-layer-like-moya" repository is a comprehensive and versatile solution for making network requests in Swift-based iOS applications using the modern async/await paradigm. Inspired by Moya, this repository simplifies and streamlines the process of integrating APIs into your iOS app, reducing boilerplate code and promoting a clean, maintainable architecture.

Key Features

Asynchronous Networking: The library leverages Swift's native async/await capabilities, making asynchronous network requests intuitive and concise.

Modularity and Extensibility: The architecture is modular, allowing you to easily add and manage multiple API endpoints with different configurations.

Endpoint Abstraction: Define API endpoints as strongly-typed Swift enums, ensuring type safety and eliminating stringly-typed URLs.

Request Abstraction: Encapsulate requests in Swift structs, enabling easy customization and reusability.

Response Mapping: Automatic parsing and mapping of API responses to Swift Codable structs, simplifying data handling.

Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages and clear HTTP status code interpretation.

Cancellation Support: Easily cancel ongoing requests to manage network traffic efficiently.

Pagination Support: Built-in support for handling paginated API responses.

Dependency Injection: Integration with dependency injection frameworks like Swinject for easy testing and dependency management.

Logging and Debugging: Extensive logging options to facilitate debugging and performance analysis.

Usage

Define Endpoints: Create Swift enums that conform to the Endpoint protocol, specifying the path, HTTP method, and any required parameters.

Create Request Structs: Define request structs for each API call, including parameters, headers, and Codable response types.

Invoke Requests: Make API calls using concise and expressive async/await syntax, eliminating callback-based spaghetti code.

Handle Responses: Automatically decode and map API responses to Swift structs or handle errors gracefully.

Dependency Injection: Seamlessly integrate the API layer into your app's dependency injection framework for testability and modularity.
